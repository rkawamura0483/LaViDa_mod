# SHIRG: Static Hierarchical Relevance Gate for High-Resolution Diffusion VLMs

## Abstract

**SHIRG (Static Hierarchical Relevance Gate)** is a training-minimal token selection method designed specifically for diffusion-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that require static prefix KV-cache management. While LaViDa achieves ~2× speedup over autoregressive VLMs through bidirectional diffusion and prefix caching, its 384×384 image resolution (729 tokens) limits performance on fine-grained OCR/VQA tasks. SHIRG bridges this gap by enabling high-resolution processing (672×672, 2,304 tokens) while maintaining cache compatibility through static token selection with minimal LoRA adaptation (1.4% parameters, <8h training).

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 LaViDa's Core Architecture and Constraints

**LaViDa** combines a SigLIP vision encoder with an 8B-parameter diffusion language model (LLaDA) that uses bidirectional attention and complementary masking. The key innovation is **prefix KV-cache reuse**: visual and text tokens are cached once at step 0 and reused across all 12-30 diffusion steps, enabling ~1.9× speedup over autoregressive VLMs.

**Critical Constraint**: The prefix cache requires **token immutability** - any change to visual tokens after step 0 invalidates the entire cache, destroying the speed advantage.

### 1.2 Resolution Limitation Impact

LaViDa's current 384×384 processing yields 729 visual tokens (27×27 patches @ 14×14 pixels each), insufficient for:
- **OCR tasks**: 4-6pt text requires ~7×7 pixel resolution per character
- **Chart understanding**: Thin tick marks, small legends, dense data points
- **Document analysis**: Fine-grained table structures, small annotations

**Performance Gap**: LaViDa underperforms LLaVA by ~9 CIDEr on ChartQA despite superior language modeling capabilities.

### 1.3 High-Resolution Scaling Challenge

Processing 672×672 images produces 2,304 tokens (48×48 patches) - **3.2× increase** that creates:
- **Memory pressure**: 20GB VRAM vs. 7.6GB baseline
- **Projection mismatch**: LaViDa's mm_projector expects 729-token sequences
- **Latency budget**: Token selection must complete in <30ms to preserve speed benefits
- **Cache inflation**: Larger prefix increases per-step memory bandwidth

## 2. Related Work: Token Selection Methods

### 2.1 Categorization by Training Requirements

| Method Category | Key Approach | Training Requirement | Diffusion Compatibility | Limitations |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Zero-shot Pruning** | Graph clustering (SAINT), region coverage (LLaVA-Scissor) | None | ✅ Single-pass, static | Poor high-res adaptation |
| **Layer-wise Reduction** | Mid-encoder pruning (FastV, "½ Tokens") | None | ✅ Static selection | Requires architecture hooks |
| **Lightweight Adaptation** | LoRA on projection layers | Minimal (<2% params) | ✅ Static, trainable | **SHIRG approach** |
| **Full Fine-tuning** | Complete adapter training (HiRes-LLaVA SMS) | Heavy (full adapter) | ❌ Too expensive | Breaks minimal training story |
| **Dynamic Selection** | Per-step token routing (Token Cropr, LaCo) | Supervised training | ❌ Cache incompatible | Violates prefix immutability |

### 2.2 Why Existing Methods Fail for Diffusion VLMs

1. **Zero-shot methods** cannot handle projection layer mismatch when scaling from 729→2,304 tokens
2. **Dynamic approaches** violate the static prefix requirement of diffusion KV-cache
3. **Full fine-tuning** is computationally expensive and unnecessary for token selection
4. **None address** the dual constraints of cache compatibility + high-resolution processing

---

## 3. SHIRG Methodology

### 3.1 Core Design Principles

1. **Static Selection**: All token choices made at step 0, preserving cache compatibility
2. **Hierarchical Coverage**: Dual-scale approach ensures both global context and fine details
3. **Training-Minimal**: LoRA adaptation on critical components only (1.4% parameters)
4. **Distance-Aware**: Spatial relationships guide token importance beyond similarity
5. **Instance-Adaptive**: Selection budget varies based on image complexity

### 3.2 Algorithm Overview

**Input**: 672×672 image → SigLIP-H/14 → 2,304 patch tokens  
**Output**: 1,152 selected tokens + 64 scaffold tokens → mm_projector → LaViDa

```
1. Dual-Scale Extraction:
   - Hi-detail: 2,304 tokens from 48×48 patches (672²÷14²)
   - Lo-res scaffold: 64 tokens from 8×8 average pooling (always kept)

2. Distance-Aware Scoring:
   - Compute text-image similarity scores (query-agnostic first pass)
   - Apply spatial distance penalties (to neighbors, to center)
   - Generate importance score: s_i = 0.7×Sim_i - 0.2×||p_i-p_neighbors|| - 0.1×||p_i-center||

3. Neighbor-Aware Merging:
   - Identify adjacent tokens with score difference < ε=0.05
   - Merge using area-weighted centroids
   - Update coordinate information

4. Hierarchical Selection:
   - Keep all 64 scaffold tokens (global context)
   - Select top-K hi-detail tokens (K=1,152 fixed, 55% keep-rate)
   - Add 2D rotary coordinate embeddings: (x,y,h,w) → 128-d vectors

5. LoRA-Adapted Projection:
   - Process [K+64] tokens through mm_projector + LoRA
   - Generate static visual prefix for cache
```

### 3.3 Detailed Component Design

#### 3.3.1 Dual-Scale Token Architecture

**Hi-Detail Tokens (2,304)**:
- Standard SigLIP processing of 672×672 image
- 48×48 patch grid at 14×14 pixel resolution
- Full spatial resolution for fine-grained features
- Subject to selection and pruning

**Lo-Res Scaffold (64)**:
- 8×8 average pooling over 48×48 feature map
- Always retained (no selection pressure)
- Provides global context and spatial anchors
- Ensures coverage of entire image region

**Coordinate Embedding**:
- Each selected token gets (x,y,width,height) coordinates
- Mapped through 2D rotary embeddings: ℝ⁴ → ℝ¹²⁸
- Added to token embeddings before projection
- Preserves spatial relationships after pruning with rotary position encoding

#### 3.3.2 Distance-Aware Importance Scoring

**Multi-Component Score**:
```
s_i = 0.7 × Similarity_i - 0.2 × Distance_neighbors - 0.1 × Distance_center

Where:
- Similarity_i: cosine similarity between token_i and text query
- Distance_neighbors: L2 distance to adjacent tokens (prevents clustering)
- Distance_center: L2 distance to image center (central bias)
```

**Spatial Distance Computation**:
- Neighbor distance: averaged over 8-connected adjacency
- Center distance: Euclidean from patch center to image center
- Normalized by image dimensions for scale invariance

#### 3.3.3 Training-Minimal LoRA Adaptation

**LoRA Target Modules** (Rank-128):
```yaml
projector_lora:
  targets: ["mm_projector.fc1", "mm_projector.fc2"]

  rank: 128
  alpha: 256

coordinate_lora:
  targets: ["coord_rotary"]
  rank: 16
  alpha: 32

Total trainable: ~230M parameters (2.7% of 8B model)
```

**Training Configuration**:
- SigLIP pre-adaptation: 20k steps at 512²-768² before LoRA
- Learning rate: 7e-5 (LoRA), 2e-5 (base weights)
- Batch size: 16 per GPU × 8 GPUs
- Epochs: 4 with cosine decay
- Mixed resolution training: 512², 672², 768² randomly sampled
- Training time: ~9 hours on 8×A100 (1.2h pre-adapt + 6h LoRA + 1.8h extended)
