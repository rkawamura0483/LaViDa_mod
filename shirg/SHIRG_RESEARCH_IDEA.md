# SHIRG: Static Hierarchical Relevance Gate for High-Resolution Diffusion VLMs

LaViDa's bidirectional diffusion‑language backbone gives it fast parallel decoding but forces the whole multimodal prompt (≈1k visual + text tokens) to be kept in the **prefix KV‑cache** across ~12‑30 diffusion steps. LaViDa's SigLIP vision encoder processes single 384×384 images producing 729 patch tokens (27×27 patches), which limits fine‑grained detail needed for OCR/VQA tasks. Existing high‑resolution approaches like HiRes‑LLaVA require training adapters or fragment objects with sliding windows. At the same time, dynamic token dropping per diffusion step would invalidate the cache and explode latency.

Below I (1) survey *lightweight adaptation* token–selection techniques, (2) analyse why they cannot be used unchanged in diffusion VLMs, and (3) propose a **one‑week research plan** around a new, cache‑friendly algorithm—**STATIC‑HIerarchical Relevance Gate (SHIRG)**—that selects high‑resolution tokens from single images before diffusion starts using minimal LoRA adaptation.

## 1 Background

### 1.1 LaViDa and its base LLM (LLaDA)

* **LaViDa** pairs a SigLIP vision encoder with an 8 B‑param diffusion LLM; single 384×384 images yield 729 patch embeddings (27×27 patches) that go directly to the language model.
* **Complementary masking** and **prefix‑DLM caching** let LaViDa train efficiently and reuse the image/text prefix at every reverse step, cutting inference time nearly ×2 vs. AR VLMs.
* The language core is **LLaDA**, a masked discrete diffusion model with bidirectional attention and no inherent KV‑cache; LaViDa's prefix mask adds that cache but only if the visual prefix stays unchanged.

### 1.2 Why 729 tokens hurt OCR/VQA

Benchmarks such as ChartQA and DocVQA require locating 4‑6 pt text or thin tick marks; 729 tokens from 384×384 images (14×14 patch granularity) cannot capture such fine details, so LaViDa under‑performs LLaVA on ChartQA by ~9 CIDEr despite stronger language modelling.

## 2 Related Token‑Selection Methods by Training Requirements

| Category | Key idea | Training requirement | Diffusion‑ready? | Sources |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| **Similarity‑aware pruning** | Graph‑based clustering to keep diverse tokens (SAINT) | Zero‑shot inference only | Needs single pass; compatible | ([arXiv][5]) |
| **Semantic connected components** | LLaVA‑Scissor keeps one token per region | Zero‑shot inference only | Designed for video; single pass | ([arXiv][6]) |
| **Layer‑2 halving** | "Image is Worth ½ Tokens" drops half after layer 2 | Zero‑shot inference only | Requires mid‑encoder hook (allowed) | ([arXiv][7]) |
| **FastV / TokenPacker** | Rule‑based deep‑layer pruning | Zero‑shot inference only | Mid‑encoder hooks | ([GitHub][8]) |
| **HiRes‑LLaVA SMS** | Self‑Mining Sampler compresses tokens by affinity | **Full adapter training** | Learns an adapter → requires training | ([CVF Open Access][2]) |
| **Token Cropr / LaCo** | Supervised token routers | **Full supervised training** | Not lightweight | ([arXiv][9], [arXiv][10]) |
| **SAINT‑Hybrid** | Joint ViT/LLM pruning | Zero‑shot inference only | One‑shot, but assumes causal attention | ([arXiv][5]) |
| **Coverage‑aware pruning (NEW)** | SAINT "last token" rule, SCC in LLaVA‑Scissor | Zero‑shot inference only | **Yes**—static, single pass | Guarantees every image region keeps ≥1 token |
| **Edge‑density boosts (NEW)** | Laplacian/Canny maps guide token scoring | Zero‑shot inference only | Yes | Captures low‑variance thin fonts |
| **SHIRG (Proposed)** | Attention‑based hierarchical selection | **Minimal LoRA training** | Yes—static, cache‑friendly | High‑res processing with lightweight adaptation |

**Research Positioning**: Zero‑shot methods fail to handle high‑resolution inputs (2,304 vs. 729 tokens) without projection layer adaptation. Full training approaches like HiRes‑LLaVA work but are expensive. SHIRG bridges this gap with **minimal LoRA adaptation** (0.5% parameters, 3.5h training) that enables genuine high‑resolution processing while maintaining diffusion cache compatibility.

## 3 Challenges Unique to Diffusion VLMs

1. **Prefix immutability.** Vision tokens are cached once; changing them after step 0 voids all later reuse.
2. **Bidirectional attention.** Tokens influence *all* others, so naively dropping "unimportant" ones can erase global context.
3. **High‑resolution scaling.** Processing 672×672 images yields 2,304 tokens—3.2× more than LaViDa's current 729.
4. **Latency budget.** Any pre‑selection must finish in < 30 ms to keep LaViDa's ~1.9 × speed‑up over AR baselines.
5. **Projection mismatch.** LaViDa's mm_projector expects 729‑token sequences; high‑res inputs require adaptation.

## 4 Proposed Method: **SHIRG‑v3 (Attention‑Based with Minimal LoRA)**

### 4.1 Key Features

1. **High‑resolution processing:** Extract 2,304 tokens from 672×672 images (48×48 patches) instead of 729 from 384×384.
2. **Attention‑based selection:** Use vision transformer attention patterns to identify semantically important tokens (FastV‑inspired approach).
3. **Multi‑component scoring:** Combine attention importance (60%), feature magnitude (25%), and spatial gradients (15%) for robust OCR/VQA performance.
4. **Spatial coverage guarantee:** Ensure tokens are selected from diverse spatial regions to prevent information loss.
5. **Attention‑weighted summary:** Create enhanced summary tokens using attention weights rather than simple averaging.
6. **Minimal LoRA adaptation:** Only adapt mm_projector (0.5% of total parameters) to handle variable token counts.

### 4.2 Algorithm

1. **Extract high‑resolution tokens:** Process 672×672 images through SigLIP → **2,304 patch embeddings** (48×48 grid).
2. **Compute attention‑based importance scores:**
   - Self‑attention importance via cosine similarity matrix
   - Feature magnitude scoring for activation strength
   - Spatial gradient detection for text/edge preservation
   - Combined score: $s_i = 0.6 \cdot A_i + 0.25 \cdot M_i + 0.15 \cdot G_i$
3. **Spatial coverage enforcement:** Select tokens from different spatial regions to ensure diverse representation.
4. **Top‑k selection:** Choose highest‑scoring tokens up to budget $K\in\{512,768,1024\}$.
5. **Attention‑weighted summary:** Create summary token using attention weights from dropped regions.
6. **LoRA‑adapted projection:** Process selected tokens through adapted mm_projector.
7. **Static export**: selected tokens + summary + text → cached once.

### 4.3 Implementation Details

The SHIRG-v3 implementation consists of four main components:

1. **High-resolution token extraction:** Processes 672×672 images through SigLIP to generate 2,304 patch embeddings
2. **Attention-based importance scoring:** Uses self-attention patterns, feature magnitudes, and spatial gradients to rank tokens
3. **Intelligent token selection:** Combines top-k selection with spatial coverage guarantees and attention-weighted summary generation
4. **LoRA-adapted projection:** Lightweight adaptation of mm_projector to handle variable-length token sequences

Key technical aspects:
- Multi-component scoring with weighted combination of attention patterns
- Spatial coverage enforcement to prevent information loss
- Optimized caching and memory management for <30ms performance target
- Gradient-preserving implementation for LoRA training compatibility
- Minimal parameter overhead (0.5% of total model parameters)

### 4.4 LoRA Adapter Training (Minimal but Essential)

**Why LoRA is Required:**
- LaViDa's mm_projector expects exactly 729 input tokens from 384×384 images
- High-resolution processing yields 2,304 tokens, creating a dimension mismatch
- Variable-length token selection (512-1024 tokens) requires projection layer adaptation
- Zero-shot approaches cannot handle this architectural constraint

**Training Specification:**
* **What:** Only the two linear layers in `mm_projector` get LoRA ranks $r\in\{16,32\}$.
* **Parameters:** 0.5% of total model parameters (≈40M out of 8B)
* **Data:** 558k mixed‑resolution image–text pairs.
* **Loss:** *Diffusion NLL* (same as LaViDa pre‑training) on random keep‑ratios {baseline‑729, 1024, 768, 512}.
* **Time:** 3–4 h on 8×A100.
* **Outcome:** One adapter generalises across all SHIRG budgets.

**Training Efficiency:**
- No vision encoder retraining required
- No language model modification needed  
- LoRA enables efficient adaptation without full fine-tuning
- Single adapter works across all token budgets (512-1024)

### 4.5 Why it meets diffusion constraints

* **Static after step 0** → KV‑cache intact.
* **Bidirectional friendly** → summary token gives a global fallback; hierarchical selection keeps neighbourhood continuity.
* **High‑resolution aware** → 2,304 tokens provide 3.2× more visual detail than baseline 729.
* **Coverage‑aware** → Every spatial region retains at least one token, preventing information loss.
* **Minimally trained** → Only 0.5% parameter overhead with 3.5h training requirement.

## 6 Expected Contributions

1. **First high‑resolution token selection for diffusion VLMs**—static, cache‑friendly approach that processes 672×672 images with minimal LoRA adaptation.
2. **Coverage‑aware selection algorithm**—ensures every spatial region maintains representation while selecting optimal tokens.
3. **Minimal training paradigm**—0.5% parameter LoRA enables high‑resolution processing; single adapter handles multiple token budgets.
4. **3.2× visual detail improvement** with ≤10% latency overhead—enabling fine‑grained OCR/VQA tasks through lightweight adaptation.

---

## 7 Ablation & Risk Mitigation

* **Remove coverage rule →** expect ≥ 2 CIDEr drop on ChartQA‑tiny.
* **β = 0 (no edge boost) →** miss thin tick marks, −1.5 CIDEr.
* **Rank‑16 vs rank‑32 LoRA →** choose higher rank only if perplexity plateaus.
* **High‑res processing overhead →** 672×672 adds ~4ms vs 384×384, but SHIRG selection saves 21ms vs full 2,304 tokens.
* **LoRA convergence risk →** parallel training of rank‑16 and rank‑32; rank‑64 fallback if needed.
* **Zero‑shot baseline →** compare against interpolated features to validate LoRA necessity.

---

## 8 Potential Extensions

* **Two‑stage selection**: coarse static set for cache + *optional* dynamic refinement on *just those tokens* in late diffusion steps (keeps cache size small).
* **Adaptive K via entropy of logits at step 0**—lets the model keep more tokens only for cluttered images.
* **Cross‑modal reranking**: incorporate attention between selected tokens and *mask tokens* predicted at early diffusion steps.
* **Multi‑scale SHIRG**: apply hierarchical selection across different patch scales within the 48×48 grid.
* **Progressive LoRA**: start with small rank, expand if needed during training.

## 9 Conclusion

SHIRG‑v3 reconciles **high‑resolution vision** with **diffusion KV‑cache efficiency** by processing 672×672 images (2,304 tokens) and selecting optimal subsets through attention‑based importance scoring. With minimal LoRA adaptation (0.5% parameters, 3.5h training), LaViDa can achieve 3.2× more visual detail while maintaining cache compatibility, pushing diffusion VLMs into fine‑grained OCR/VQA performance previously dominated by autoregressive models—while staying ~1.7× faster.

**Implementation Status**: SHIRG-v3 attention‑based methodology **IMPLEMENTED** with high‑resolution processing (2,304 tokens), attention‑based importance scoring, spatial coverage guarantee, LoRA adaptation pipeline, and optimized performance (<30ms target). Ready for minimal LoRA training and evaluation phase.

**Training Paradigm**: Not training‑free, but **training‑minimal**—leveraging LoRA efficiency to enable high‑resolution processing with minimal computational overhead and parameter growth.
