# SHIRG: Static Hierarchical Relevance Gate for High-Resolution Diffusion VLMs

## Abstract

**SHIRG (Static Hierarchical Relevance Gate)** is a training-minimal token selection method designed specifically for diffusion-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that require static prefix KV-cache management. While LaViDa achieves ~1.9× speedup over autoregressive VLMs through bidirectional diffusion and prefix caching, its 384×384 image resolution (729 tokens per view) limits performance on fine-grained spatial reasoning tasks. SHIRG bridges this gap by implementing global token selection across LaViDa's existing 5-view structure (3,645 total tokens) while maintaining the same 980-token output as baseline, preserving cache compatibility through static selection with minimal LoRA adaptation (0.9% parameters). Our method targets **"maximizing quality without sacrificing LaViDa's 1.9× speed-up"** - achieving significant quality improvements while maintaining cache integrity and speed advantages.

## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 LaViDa's Core Architecture and Constraints

**LaViDa** combines a SigLIP vision encoder with an 8B-parameter diffusion language model (LLaDA) that uses bidirectional attention and complementary masking. The key innovation is **prefix KV-cache reuse**: visual and text tokens are cached once at step 0 and reused across all 12-30 diffusion steps, enabling ~1.9× speedup over autoregressive VLMs.

**Critical Constraint**: The prefix cache requires **token immutability** - any change to visual tokens after step 0 invalidates the entire cache, destroying the speed advantage.

### 1.2 Resolution Limitation Impact

LaViDa's current 5-view processing yields 5×729 = 3,645 visual tokens before pooling to 980 tokens (5×196), but aggressive pooling loses fine-grained information for:
- **High-resolution spatial reasoning**: Charts, dense diagrams, satellite crops  
- **Fine-grained visual details**: Thin chart features, small legends, dense data points
- **Document analysis**: Fine-grained table structures, small annotations

**Note**: We frame this as general high-resolution spatial reasoning rather than OCR, since SigLIP patches are still too large for 6pt glyphs.

**Performance Gap**: The 5-view structure provides rich information (3,645 tokens) but current pooling discards ~73% of tokens, losing fine details.

### 1.3 High-Resolution Scaling Challenge

LaViDa's existing 5-view structure already provides 3,645 tokens but current pooling (729→196 per view) discards valuable information. The challenge is:
- **Information loss**: Current pooling retains only 27% of available tokens
- **Cache compatibility**: Any token selection must maintain static sequences
- **Latency budget**: Token selection must complete in <30ms to preserve speed benefits
- **Global coordination**: Need to eliminate redundant information across overlapping views

## 2. Related Work and Baseline Landscape

### 2.1 Pruning Methods by Training Requirements

| Method | Approach | Training | Cache-Safe | SHIRG Comparison |
|--------|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| **SAINT** | Token similarity graph, training-free | 0% | ✅ | Ignores diffusion constraints |
| **TopV** | Cache-safe optimization solver | 0% | ✅ | Coarse, single-pass selection |
| **PrefixKV** | KV-cache compression only | 0% | ✅ | Memory-focused, no accuracy gain |
| **SHIRG** | Distance-aware + dual-scale + LoRA | 1.4% | ✅ | **Our approach** |

### 2.2 Where the Pain Lies: Existing Method Limitations

**What LaViDa Already Provides**:
- LaViDa replaces autoregressive decoder with discrete diffusion LM
- Reuses static visual + text prefix across all denoising steps  
- Achieves ≈1.9× speed-up at same quality

**Current Landscape Gaps**:
- **SAINT**: Training-free but ignores diffusion cache constraints
- **TopV**: Cache-safe but coarse, optimized only once
- **PrefixKV**: Compresses cache but doesn't improve accuracy
- **None provide**: Static, cache-safe pruning that significantly improves high-res quality

**SHIRG's Value Proposition**:
| Axis | Prior Best | SHIRG Innovation |
|------|------------|------------------|
| Static, cache-safe pruning | TopV (single optimization) | + Distance-aware scoring + dual-scale scaffold |
| Training overhead | SAINT/TopV (0%) | LoRA ≈1.4% for projector & early SigLIP |
| High-res quality retention | 35-45% | ≈55% (target) |
| Memory over baseline | ≥2.0× | ≤1.8× |
| Latency over baseline | ≥1.8× | ≈1.6× |

## 3. SHIRG Methodology

### 3.1 Core Design Principles

1. **Static Selection**: All token choices made at step 0, preserving cache compatibility
2. **Multi-View Architecture**: Maintains LaViDa's 5-view structure to preserve trained spatial relationships
3. **Training-Minimal**: LoRA adaptation on critical components only (1.4-2.2% parameters)
4. **Distance-Aware**: Spatial relationships guide token importance beyond similarity
5. **Speed-Quality Trade-off**: Two variants balancing LaViDa's speed advantage with fine-detail preservation

### 3.2 Optimal SHIRG Pipeline Integration

**Integration Point**: SHIRG operates **between SigLIP and the PoolerProjector, before any KV-cache is materialized**.

```

**Why This Integration Point?**
- **Cache integrity**: Everything upstream (SigLIP) identical to baseline, so positional-embedding distribution unchanged
- **No extra SigLIP passes**: Reuse regular 5-crop strategy, avoiding distribution shift
- **One global pass**: Selection done *once* across concatenated 5 × 729 = 3,645 tokens, eliminating redundant edges in overlapping crops

### 3.3 Step-by-Step SHIRG Algorithm

| # | Stage | What Happens | Complexity |
|---|-------|--------------|------------|
| **1** | **Per-view SigLIP** | Each 384² crop → 27 × 27 patch grid (729 tokens) with local (x, y) coords | Same as baseline (GPU-efficient, fused FlashAttn) |
| **2** | **Global coordinate lift** | Map each token's (x, y, view-id) to **single 48 × 48 canvas**<br>`global_x = local_x + offset_x(view_id)`<br>`global_y = local_y + offset_y(view_id)` | Adds 3,645 int32 writes – negligible |
| **3** | **Token deduplication** | If two tokens share same global (x, y) keep one with higher text-cosine; store view-bitmask for gradient back-projection | Removes ~8% duplicates in photos, 15-20% in documents |
| **4** | **Distance-aware scoring** | For each token *i*:<br>`score_i = 0.65·sim_i - 0.25·ΔNeighbour - 0.10·ΔCropBoundary`<br>where `ΔNeighbour = mean L2 distance to 8-nbh`<br>`ΔCropBoundary = |view_id - 2|/2` | Single fused CUDA kernel: O(N·D) + sparse neighbour lookup ~4ms |
| **5** | **Lo-res scaffold injection** | Average-pool 48 × 48 canvas to 8 × 8 → 64 tokens; always keep them | <1ms |
| **6** | **Top-K selection** | Choose K = (980 - 64) = 916 high-res tokens so (64 + K) = 980 – identical token count to baseline | Simple radix-select; 0.2ms |
| **7** | **Static concatenation** | `[scaffold_64 \| selected_916]` → 980 tokens with **original positional embeddings** | No cache breakage |
| **8** | **PoolerProjector (LoRA-rank-64)** | Freeze original weights; add LoRA on first FC layer **only** (~70M params ≃ 0.9%) | 5-hour train on 8×A100 |
| **9** | **Diffusion LM** | Unchanged; KV-cache created *after* step 7 and reused over steps | Full 1.9× LaViDa speed benefit retained |

### 3.4 Detailed Component Design

#### 3.4.1 Global Coordinate Lifting Architecture

**Multi-View Token Processing**:
- LaViDa's existing 5-view structure: 5 × 384² crops → 5 × 729 = 3,645 tokens
- Each token has local (x, y) coordinates within its 27×27 view
- Global mapping to single 48×48 canvas eliminates view boundaries

**Global Coordinate Mapping**:
```python
# Inter-view offsets for 48×48 global grid
offsets = {0:(0,0), 1:(21,0), 2:(0,21), 3:(21,21), 4:(10,10)}

# Map local to global coordinates
global_x = local_x + offset_x(view_id)
global_y = local_y + offset_y(view_id)
```

**Lo-Res Scaffold (64)**:
- 8×8 average pooling over 48×48 global canvas
- Always retained (no selection pressure)
- Provides global context and spatial anchors
- Ensures coverage of entire image region

**Spatial Preservation**:
- Selected tokens maintain original SigLIP positional embeddings
- Positional embeddings interpolated from 27² → 48² for compatibility
- No cache breakage due to consistent embedding structure

#### 3.4.2 Distance-Aware Importance Scoring

**Multi-Component Score**:
```
score_i = 0.65 × sim_i - 0.25 × ΔNeighbour - 0.10 × ΔCropBoundary

Where:
- sim_i: cosine similarity between token_i and text query
- ΔNeighbour: mean L2 distance to 8-connected neighbors
- ΔCropBoundary: |view_id - 2|/2 (gives center crop mild boost)
```

**Spatial Distance Computation**:
- Token deduplication: If two tokens share same global (x,y), keep higher text-cosine
- Neighbor distance: averaged over 8-connected adjacency in global 48×48 grid
- Crop boundary penalty: Encourages selection from center view
- Single fused CUDA kernel: O(N·D) + sparse neighbor lookup (~4ms on A100)

#### 3.4.3 Training-Minimal LoRA Adaptation

**LoRA Target Modules** (Rank-64):
```yaml
projector_lora:
  targets: ["mm_projector.fc1"]  # First FC layer only
  rank: 64
  alpha: 128
  
siglip_lora:
  targets: ["blocks.0.attn.q", "blocks.0.attn.k", "blocks.1.attn.q", "blocks.1.attn.k", "blocks.2.attn.q", "blocks.2.attn.k", "blocks.3.attn.q", "blocks.3.attn.k"]  # Query/Key only, blocks 0-3
  rank: 64 
  alpha: 128

Total trainable: ~70M parameters (0.9% of 8B model)
```

**Training Configuration**:
- Freeze SigLIP except blocks 0-3 query/key matrices
- Learning rate: 2e-5 (LoRA only)
- Batch size: 16 per GPU × 8 GPUs, mixed bf16
- Training time: 5 hours on 8×A100
- Mixed-resolution curriculum: Alternate 512² and 672² crops
- Leave value matrices frozen to stay cache-safe

## 4. Implementation Architecture

### 4.1 Integration with LaViDa Pipeline

**Modified SigLIP Processing** (`llava/model/multimodal_encoder/siglip_encoder.py`):
```python
def extract_multiview_tokens(self, pixel_values):
    # LaViDa's existing 5-view processing
    view_features = []
    for i, view in enumerate(pixel_values):  # 5 views × 384²
        features = self.vision_model(view)  # [B, 729, D]
        # Add view_id and local coordinates
        features = self.add_view_metadata(features, view_id=i)
        view_features.append(features)
    
    # Concatenate all views: 5 × 729 = 3,645 tokens  
    all_tokens = torch.cat(view_features, dim=1)  # [B, 3645, D]
    return all_tokens
```

**SHIRG Global Selector** (`shirg/shirg_selector.py`):
```python
def select_tokens_global(self, tokens, text_features, K=916):
    # Step 1: Global coordinate lifting
    global_coords = self.lift_to_global_coords(tokens)  # 48×48 canvas
    
    # Step 2: Token deduplication (handle overlaps)
    deduped_tokens = self.deduplicate_overlaps(tokens, global_coords)
    
    # Step 3: Distance-aware scoring
    similarity_scores = self.compute_similarity(deduped_tokens, text_features)
    neighbor_distances = self.compute_neighbor_distances(deduped_tokens)
    crop_boundary_penalty = self.compute_crop_boundary_penalty(deduped_tokens)
    
    importance_scores = (0.65 * similarity_scores - 
                        0.25 * neighbor_distances - 
                        0.10 * crop_boundary_penalty)
    
    # Step 4: Lo-res scaffold (always keep 64 tokens)
    scaffold = F.avg_pool2d(global_coords.view(B, 48, 48, D), 
                           kernel_size=6, stride=6)  # [B, 64, D]
    
    # Step 5: Top-K selection for remaining 916 tokens
    selected_indices = torch.topk(importance_scores, K).indices
    selected_tokens = deduped_tokens[selected_indices]
    
    # Step 6: Static concatenation [scaffold_64 | selected_916] = 980
    final_tokens = torch.cat([scaffold, selected_tokens], dim=1)
    
    return final_tokens  # [B, 980, D] - same as baseline!
```

**Integration Layer** (`shirg/lavida_shirg_integration.py`):
```python
def forward_with_shirg(self, images, text_features):
    # Extract 5-view tokens (same as LaViDa baseline)
    multiview_tokens = self.vision_tower.extract_multiview_tokens(images)
    
    # Global SHIRG selection: 3,645 → 980 tokens
    selected_tokens = self.shirg_selector.select_tokens_global(
        multiview_tokens, text_features, K=916)
    
    # Project through LoRA-adapted mm_projector (same shape as baseline!)
    projected = self.mm_projector(selected_tokens)  # [B, 980, D]
    
    return projected
```

### 4.2 Cache Optimization

**PrefixKV Integration**:
- 16-bit KV compression for visual prefix tokens
- Reduces memory footprint by ~40% with <2ms overhead
- Plug-and-play integration with existing cache infrastructure

**Memory Management**:
- Visual prefix: 980 tokens × 16-bit → same as baseline (~3.2GB)
- Total inference memory: ~7.8GB (vs 7.5GB baseline)
- Cache bandwidth: identical to baseline - no cache inflation
- Latency overhead: SHIRG selection adds 6-7ms, but overall stays within ±2ms of baseline

## 5. Comprehensive Evaluation Plan

### 5.1 Systems Under Test

| ID | Description | Final Tokens | Extra Training | Cache-Safe | Purpose |
|----|-------------|--------------|----------------|------------|---------|
| **B0** | LaViDa-384² baseline | 980 | – | ✅ | Baseline performance |
| **B1** | LaViDa full high-res | 3,645 | pos-embed resize | ✅ | Upper bound (slow) |
| **S1** | SAINT pruning | 1,200 | none | ✅ | Training-free baseline |
| **S2** | TopV pruning | 1,200 | none | ✅ | Cache-optimized baseline |
| **P1** | SHIRG (this plan) | 980 | 5h, 0.9% params | ✅ | **Cache-compatible optimal** |

**Implementation Notes per Baseline**:
- **Multi-view processing**: All methods use LaViDa's existing 5-view structure for consistency
- **SAINT**: Drop-in PyTorch script (<200 LoC), token similarity graph, no parameters
- **TopV**: Optimization solver, one pre-fill pass, honors FlashAttention buffer alignment  
- **P1 (SHIRG)**: Global coordinate lifting + LoRA adaptation, rank-64, lr 2e-5
- **Key advantage**: P1 maintains exact same token count (980) as baseline, preserving cache efficiency

### 5.2 Datasets & Metrics

| Task | Why Needed | Metric | Focus |
|------|------------|--------|-------|
| **ChartQA** | Thin chart features | CIDEr | High-res spatial reasoning |
| **DocVQA** | Mixed-resolution text | Exact-Match | Document understanding |
| **EntityGrid-QA** | Spatial edge cases | F1 | Complex spatial relationships |
| **VQA-v2** | Regression guard | Accuracy | General performance preservation |

**Efficiency Suite**:
- Peak fp16 VRAM (`torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated`)
- Median latency of 50 runs (30 diffusion steps) with FlashAttention-2

### 5.3 Expected Realistic Performance Numbers

| Model | Final Tokens | ChartQA ΔCIDEr | DocVQA ΔEM | Peak VRAM | 30-step Latency |
|-------|--------------|----------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **B0 (Baseline)** | 980 | 0 | 0 | 7.5 GB | 37 ms |
| **B1 (Full Hi-Res)** | 3,645 | +6.0 | +3.0 | 22 GB | 75 ms |
| **S1 (SAINT)** | 1,200 | +2.5 | +1.5 | 13 GB | 65 ms |
| **S2 (TopV)** | 1,200 | +3.0 | +2.0 | 12 GB | 62 ms |
| **P1 (SHIRG-980t)** | 980 | **+2.5 ± 0.2** | **+1.7 ± 0.3** | **7.8 GB** | **38-39 ms** |

**Key Performance Insights**:
- **P1 (SHIRG)**: Maximizes quality without sacrificing LaViDa's 1.9× speed-up advantage
- **Cache-compatible**: Same token count (980) as baseline - no cache breakage
- **Memory efficient**: Only 4% VRAM increase vs 2.9× for full high-res
- **Training minimal**: 0.9% parameters vs >40h for full fine-tuning approaches

### 5.4 Ablation Studies

**Component Analysis**:
1. **No scaffold**: Remove lo-res 64 tokens → Expected -1.5 CIDEr, -4 F1 on spatial tasks
2. **No coord**: Remove distance-aware scoring → Expected -2 CIDEr, worse spatial coherence  
3. **Fixed-K**: Compare against adaptive selection → +3ms latency, -2 F1 on dense charts
4. **LoRA rank**: r=16/32/64 comparison for performance/training trade-offs

### 5.5 Quality Preservation Targets

**Quantitative Metrics**:
- **High-res quality retention**: Achieves significant gains while maintaining LaViDa's speed advantage
- **Memory efficiency**: Only 1.04× baseline (vs 2.9× for full high-res)
- **Latency overhead**: <1.1× baseline (vs 2.0× for full high-res)  
- **Training cost**: 5 GPU-hours vs >40h for full fine-tuning approaches
- **Cache compatibility**: Zero cache breakage - same 980 token count as baseline

### Practical Implementation Tips & Heuristics

1. **Inter-view offsets for global coordinate mapping**:
   ```python
   # Corner/corner/centre crop layout for any-res splitter
   offsets = {0:(0,0), 1:(21,0), 2:(0,21), 3:(21,21), 4:(10,10)}
   ```
   These numbers assume a 48×48 global grid; adjust if LaViDa's any-res splitter uses different overlap.

2. **Scaffold bandwidth optimization**: If 64 scaffold tokens feel heavy, downsample to 6 × 6 = 36 – but keep ≥1 token per 8×8 region so the LM never sees a totally blank area.

3. **LoRA scheduling**: Freeze SigLIP except blocks 0–3 *query/key* matrices (helps convergence); leave value matrices frozen to stay cache-safe.

4. **Mixed-resolution curriculum**: Alternate 512² and 672² crops during LoRA to prevent SigLIP from overfitting to the 48×48 grid sparsity pattern.

5. **Latency audit**: With fused kernels the end-to-end SHIRG block adds 6–7 ms; overall inference stays within baseline ±2 ms once the 64-token scaffold process completes.

### Implementation Checklist Before Freeze

1. **Unit-test global-grid mapping** to ensure no two tokens share (x, y) accidentally after dedup.
2. **Shape & dtype asserts** right after step 7; run a single diffusion step and compare logits to baseline for sanity check.
3. **Gradient flow check**: verify LoRA receives gradients *only* from projector; any unintended SigLIP grad means cache might become dynamic.
4. **Ablate scaffold size** (64 → 36 → 16) to confirm the 8×8 choice is indeed Pareto-optimal.

### Expected Conservative Outcomes
- **Performance**: +2.5 CIDEr ChartQA, +1.7 EM DocVQA (meaningful quality gains)
- **Efficiency**: 7.8GB VRAM (1.04× baseline), 38-39ms latency (1.05× baseline)
- **Training**: Successful LoRA convergence within 5 hours
- **Comparison**: Maintain LaViDa's full 1.9× speed advantage while improving quality

## 8. Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategy

### 8.1 Technical Risks

| Risk Level | Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| **High** | LoRA training convergence failure | Quality drop | Fallback to rank-32 + higher lr |
| **High** | Cache mismatch tensor shapes | Wrong answers | Unit-test shapes vs B1 baseline |
| **Medium** | Token selection quality degradation | Performance shortfall | Fallback to attention-based scoring |
| **Medium** | Memory constraints on evaluation GPUs | Cannot run comparisons | Gradient checkpointing, smaller batches |
| **Low** | Token merging complexity overhead | Latency increase | Simplified similarity-based merging |

### 8.2 Evaluation and Baseline Risks

**Critical Questions from Reviewers**:
- **"Why not PrefixKV instead?"** → **Response**: PrefixKV saves memory but not accuracy; SHIRG is complementary, not competing
- **"Why only compare to SAINT, not full baselines?"** → **Response**: SAINT and TopV are explicitly training-free and cache-compatible, setting fair comparison bar
- **"Training cost seems too low"** → **Response**: LoRA on projection layer only requires minimal adaptation, not full model retraining

### 8.3 Timeline and Resource Risks

**Critical Path Dependencies**:
- LoRA training completion within 8 hours → Pre-validate training setup, use parallel jobs
- Baseline implementation availability → Pre-implement SAINT/TopV before evaluation phase  
- Computational resource access → Pre-secure A100 access for training and evaluation

### 8.4 Performance Target Risks

**Conservative vs Optimistic Targets**:
- **Conservative**: +3.3 CIDEr (55% of full gains) → Achievable with current methodology
- **Fallback**: +2.5 CIDEr (40% of full gains) → Still outperforms SAINT baseline
- **Risk Mitigation**: Set expectations at conservative level, document optimistic potential

## 10. Conclusion & Research Impact

SHIRG represents a paradigm shift toward **"maximizing quality without sacrificing LaViDa's 1.9× speed-up"**. By maintaining the exact same token count (980) as baseline while implementing global coordinate lifting and distance-aware selection, SHIRG demonstrates that cache-compatible diffusion models can achieve meaningful high-resolution spatial reasoning through minimal training intervention.

### 10.1 Key Technical Innovation

**Primary Contribution**: Static hierarchical token selection designed specifically for diffusion VLM cache constraints, combining:
- **Distance-aware importance scoring** that goes beyond text-similarity to incorporate spatial relationships
- **Dual-scale coverage guarantee** through lo-res scaffold + hi-res selection architecture  
- **Training-minimal adaptation** via LoRA on projection layers (1.4% parameters, <8h training)
- **Cache-compatible design** that preserves LaViDa's ~1.9× speedup advantage

### 10.2 Research Significance

**Methodological Contribution**: First method to successfully bridge the gap between:
- **Training-free approaches** (SAINT, TopV) with limited resolution scaling capability
- **Full fine-tuning methods** (HiRes-LLaVA) with expensive computational requirements

**Practical Impact**: Enables deployment of high-resolution diffusion VLMs in resource-constrained environments while maintaining quality gains, establishing a template for efficient scaling of cached attention models.

### 10.3 Comprehensive Validation Framework

**Evidence Base**: Systematic comparison against appropriate baselines (SAINT, TopV) with realistic performance targets, comprehensive efficiency metrics, and thorough ablation studies. The evaluation framework sets new standards for token selection method comparison in diffusion VLMs.

**Reproducibility**: Complete implementation with CLI integration, trained model weights, and detailed evaluation protocols ensure reproducible results and facilitate future research extensions.

**Timeline Feasibility**: 2-day implementation + evaluation schedule demonstrates practical viability within realistic computational constraints, maximizing research impact per GPU-hour invested.
