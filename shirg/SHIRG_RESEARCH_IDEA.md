# SHIRG: Static Hierarchical Relevance Gate for High-Resolution Diffusion VLMs

## Abstract

**SHIRG (Static Hierarchical Relevance Gate)** is a training-minimal token selection method designed specifically for diffusion-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that require static prefix KV-cache management. While LaViDa achieves ~1.9× speedup over autoregressive VLMs through bidirectional diffusion and prefix caching, its 384×384 image resolution (729 tokens) limits performance on fine-grained spatial reasoning tasks. SHIRG bridges this gap by enabling high-resolution processing (672×672, 2,304 tokens) while maintaining cache compatibility through static token selection with minimal LoRA adaptation (1.4% parameters). Our method targets **"static, diffusion-compatible pruning that halves the cost of high-res inference while keeping half the gain"** - achieving ~55% of the full high-resolution quality improvement at 1.8× memory cost instead of 3×.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 LaViDa's Core Architecture and Constraints

**LaViDa** combines a SigLIP vision encoder with an 8B-parameter diffusion language model (LLaDA) that uses bidirectional attention and complementary masking. The key innovation is **prefix KV-cache reuse**: visual and text tokens are cached once at step 0 and reused across all 12-30 diffusion steps, enabling ~1.9× speedup over autoregressive VLMs.

**Critical Constraint**: The prefix cache requires **token immutability** - any change to visual tokens after step 0 invalidates the entire cache, destroying the speed advantage.

### 1.2 Resolution Limitation Impact

LaViDa's current 384×384 processing yields 729 visual tokens (27×27 patches @ 14×14 pixels each), insufficient for:
- **High-resolution spatial reasoning**: Charts, dense diagrams, satellite crops  
- **Fine-grained visual details**: Thin chart features, small legends, dense data points
- **Document analysis**: Fine-grained table structures, small annotations

**Note**: We frame this as general high-resolution spatial reasoning rather than OCR, since SigLIP patches are still too large for 6pt glyphs.

**Performance Gap**: Full 672² inference adds +6 CIDEr on ChartQA but costs ~3× memory and +100% latency.

### 1.3 High-Resolution Scaling Challenge

Processing 672×672 images produces 2,304 tokens (48×48 patches) - **3.2× increase** that creates:
- **Memory pressure**: 20GB VRAM vs. 7.6GB baseline
- **Projection mismatch**: LaViDa's mm_projector expects 729-token sequences
- **Latency budget**: Token selection must complete in <30ms to preserve speed benefits
- **Cache inflation**: Larger prefix increases per-step memory bandwidth

## 2. Related Work and Baseline Landscape

### 2.1 Pruning Methods by Training Requirements

| Method | Approach | Training | Cache-Safe | SHIRG Comparison |
|--------|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| **SAINT** | Token similarity graph, training-free | 0% | ✅ | Ignores diffusion constraints |
| **TopV** | Cache-safe optimization solver | 0% | ✅ | Coarse, single-pass selection |
| **PrefixKV** | KV-cache compression only | 0% | ✅ | Memory-focused, no accuracy gain |
| **SHIRG** | Distance-aware + dual-scale + LoRA | 1.4% | ✅ | **Our approach** |

### 2.2 Where the Pain Lies: Existing Method Limitations

**What LaViDa Already Provides**:
- LaViDa replaces autoregressive decoder with discrete diffusion LM
- Reuses static visual + text prefix across all denoising steps  
- Achieves ≈1.9× speed-up at same quality

**Current Landscape Gaps**:
- **SAINT**: Training-free but ignores diffusion cache constraints
- **TopV**: Cache-safe but coarse, optimized only once
- **PrefixKV**: Compresses cache but doesn't improve accuracy
- **None provide**: Static, cache-safe pruning that significantly improves high-res quality

**SHIRG's Value Proposition**:
| Axis | Prior Best | SHIRG Innovation |
|------|------------|------------------|
| Static, cache-safe pruning | TopV (single optimization) | + Distance-aware scoring + dual-scale scaffold |
| Training overhead | SAINT/TopV (0%) | LoRA ≈1.4% for projector & early SigLIP |
| High-res quality retention | 35-45% | ≈55% (target) |
| Memory over baseline | ≥2.0× | ≤1.8× |
| Latency over baseline | ≥1.8× | ≈1.6× |

## 3. SHIRG Methodology

### 3.1 Core Design Principles

1. **Static Selection**: All token choices made at step 0, preserving cache compatibility
2. **Hierarchical Coverage**: Dual-scale approach ensures both global context and fine details
3. **Training-Minimal**: LoRA adaptation on critical components only (1.4% parameters)
4. **Distance-Aware**: Spatial relationships guide token importance beyond similarity
5. **Instance-Adaptive**: Selection budget varies based on image complexity

### 3.2 Algorithm Overview

**Input**: 672×672 image → SigLIP-H/14 → 2,304 patch tokens  
**Output**: 1,152 selected tokens + 64 scaffold tokens → mm_projector → LaViDa

```
1. Dual-Scale Extraction:
   - Hi-detail: 2,304 tokens from 48×48 patches (672²÷14²)
   - Lo-res scaffold: 64 tokens from 8×8 average pooling (always kept)

2. Distance-Aware Scoring:
   - Compute text-image similarity scores (query-agnostic first pass)
   - Apply spatial distance penalties (to neighbors, to center)
   - Generate importance score: s_i = 0.7×Sim_i - 0.2×||p_i-p_neighbors|| - 0.1×||p_i-center||

3. Neighbor-Aware Merging:
   - Identify adjacent tokens with score difference < ε=0.05
   - Merge using area-weighted centroids
   - Update coordinate information

4. Hierarchical Selection:
   - Keep all 64 scaffold tokens (global context)
   - Select top-K hi-detail tokens (K=1,152 fixed, 55% keep-rate)

5. LoRA-Adapted Projection:
   - Process [K+64] tokens through mm_projector + LoRA
   - Generate static visual prefix for cache
```

### 3.3 Detailed Component Design

#### 3.3.1 Dual-Scale Token Architecture

**Hi-Detail Tokens (2,304)**:
- Standard SigLIP processing of 672×672 image
- 48×48 patch grid at 14×14 pixel resolution
- Full spatial resolution for fine-grained features
- Subject to selection and pruning

**Lo-Res Scaffold (64)**:
- 8×8 average pooling over 48×48 feature map
- Always retained (no selection pressure)
- Provides global context and spatial anchors
- Ensures coverage of entire image region

**Spatial Preservation**:
- Selected tokens maintain their original positional embeddings from SigLIP
- No additional coordinate processing required
- Spatial relationships preserved through existing position encoding

#### 3.3.2 Distance-Aware Importance Scoring

**Multi-Component Score**:
```
s_i = 0.7 × Similarity_i - 0.2 × Distance_neighbors - 0.1 × Distance_center

Where:
- Similarity_i: cosine similarity between token_i and text query
- Distance_neighbors: L2 distance to adjacent tokens (prevents clustering)
- Distance_center: L2 distance to image center (central bias)
```

**Spatial Distance Computation**:
- Neighbor distance: averaged over 8-connected adjacency
- Center distance: Euclidean from patch center to image center
- Normalized by image dimensions for scale invariance

#### 3.3.3 Training-Minimal LoRA Adaptation

**LoRA Target Modules** (Rank-128):
```yaml
projector_lora:
  targets: ["mm_projector.fc1", "mm_projector.fc2"]
  rank: 128
  alpha: 256
  
siglip_lora:
  targets: ["blocks.0.attn.qkv", "blocks.1.attn.qkv", "blocks.2.attn.qkv", "blocks.3.attn.qkv", "blocks.4.attn.qkv", "blocks.5.attn.qkv", "blocks.6.attn.qkv", "blocks.7.attn.qkv"]
  rank: 128
  alpha: 256

Total trainable: ~220M parameters (2.6% of 8B model)
```

**Training Configuration**:
- SigLIP pre-adaptation: 20k steps at 512²-768² before LoRA
- Learning rate: 7e-5 (LoRA), 2e-5 (base weights)
- Batch size: 16 per GPU × 8 GPUs
- Epochs: 4 with cosine decay
- Mixed resolution training: 512², 672², 768² randomly sampled
- Training time: ~9 hours on 8×A100 (1.2h pre-adapt + 6h LoRA + 1.8h extended)

- Total inference memory: ~11GB (vs 20GB full high-res)
- Cache bandwidth: optimized through streaming and compression

## 8. Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategy

### 8.1 Technical Risks

| Risk Level | Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| **High** | LoRA training convergence failure | Quality drop | Fallback to rank-32 + higher lr |
| **High** | Cache mismatch tensor shapes | Wrong answers | Unit-test shapes vs B1 baseline |
| **Medium** | Token selection quality degradation | Performance shortfall | Fallback to attention-based scoring |
| **Medium** | Memory constraints on evaluation GPUs | Cannot run comparisons | Gradient checkpointing, smaller batches |
| **Low** | Token merging complexity overhead | Latency increase | Simplified similarity-based merging |

### 8.2 Evaluation and Baseline Risks

**Critical Questions from Reviewers**:
- **"Why not PrefixKV instead?"** → **Response**: PrefixKV saves memory but not accuracy; SHIRG is complementary, not competing
- **"Why only compare to SAINT, not full baselines?"** → **Response**: SAINT and TopV are explicitly training-free and cache-compatible, setting fair comparison bar
- **"Training cost seems too low"** → **Response**: LoRA on projection layer only requires minimal adaptation, not full model retraining

### 8.3 Timeline and Resource Risks

**Critical Path Dependencies**:
- LoRA training completion within 8 hours → Pre-validate training setup, use parallel jobs
- Baseline implementation availability → Pre-implement SAINT/TopV before evaluation phase  
- Computational resource access → Pre-secure A100 access for training and evaluation

### 8.4 Performance Target Risks

**Conservative vs Optimistic Targets**:
- **Conservative**: +3.3 CIDEr (55% of full gains) → Achievable with current methodology
- **Fallback**: +2.5 CIDEr (40% of full gains) → Still outperforms SAINT baseline
- **Risk Mitigation**: Set expectations at conservative level, document optimistic potential
