# SHIRG LoRA Training Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-07-30

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to resolve errors in the SHIRG LoRA pre-training test suite.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. PIL Image ndim Error
**Error**: `'Image' object has no attribute 'ndim'`
**Location**: `llava/model/llava_arch.py:382`

**Root Cause**: LaViDa's `prepare_inputs_labels_for_multimodal` function was trying to access the `ndim` attribute on PIL Image objects, which don't have this attribute.

**Fix**: Added type checking to handle both PIL Images and tensors:
- Check if object is PIL Image before accessing `ndim`
- Process PIL Images through `process_images` before concatenation
- Maintain compatibility with both tensor and PIL Image inputs

**Files Modified**:
- `llava/model/llava_arch.py`: Lines 380-451

### 2. CUDA Indexing Error
**Error**: `CUDA error: device-side assert triggered - Assertion srcIndex < srcSelectDimSize failed`
**Location**: During training step when processing concatenated views

**Root Cause**: Multiple issues:
1. SHIRG mode was not being enabled on the vision tower (`shirg_enabled=False`)
2. Image processing was using LaViDa's 5-view format instead of SHIRG's 2-view format
3. Missing bounds checking for patch dimensions

**Fix**: 
1. Ensured SHIRG is properly enabled on vision tower by setting `shirg_enabled` directly
2. Added SHIRG configuration to model config before image processing
3. Added validation and bounds checking for patch dimensions
4. Added error recovery for non-standard patch sizes

**Files Modified**:
- `shirg/train_shirg_lora.py`: Lines 141-170, 348-363
- `shirg/test_shirg_lora_pretrain.py`: Lines 692-720
- `llava/model/multimodal_encoder/siglip_encoder.py`: Lines 710-752

### 3. SHIRG 2-View Mode Configuration
**Issue**: SHIRG was not using the correct 2-view processing mode (1×384² + 1×448²)

**Fix**: Ensured proper configuration propagation:
- Set `enable_shirg=True` on model config
- Set `shirg_3view_mode=True` to enable 2-view processing
- Updated vision tower configuration at multiple levels

## Implementation Details

### Configuration Propagation
The SHIRG configuration needs to be set at multiple levels:
1. Model config: `model.config.enable_shirg = True`
2. Vision tower instance: `vision_tower.shirg_enabled = True`
3. Vision tower config: `vision_tower.config.enable_shirg = True`
4. Vision tower cfg dict/object: `vision_tower.vision_tower_cfg['enable_shirg'] = True`

### Image Processing Flow
1. PIL Images are detected in `prepare_inputs_labels_for_multimodal`
2. They are processed through `process_images` with SHIRG mode enabled
3. SHIRG 2-view processing creates 1×384² global + 1×448² foveal views
4. Total output: 980 tokens (256 global + 724 foveal)

### Error Recovery
Added comprehensive error handling:
- Validate tensor shapes before processing
- Catch CUDA indexing errors and attempt recovery
- Resize non-standard patches if needed
- Provide detailed debug output for troubleshooting

## Testing

Created `test_shirg_fixes.py` to verify:
1. PIL Image handling without ndim errors
2. SHIRG configuration propagation
3. 2-view image processing mode

## Next Steps

1. Run the full test suite again to verify all fixes:
   ```bash
   python shirg/test_shirg_lora_pretrain.py
   ```

2. If tests pass, proceed with actual training:
   ```bash
   python shirg/train_shirg_lora.py --selection-method full
   ```

## Key Insights

1. **Multi-level Configuration**: SHIRG configuration must be set at multiple levels due to LaViDa's architecture
2. **Image Format Flexibility**: The system needs to handle both PIL Images and tensors seamlessly
3. **2-View vs 5-View**: SHIRG uses a different view format than standard LaViDa, requiring careful mode switching
4. **Bounds Checking**: CUDA errors often stem from dimension mismatches that need validation

## Research Impact

These fixes ensure that:
- SHIRG-Fovea can properly process its 2-view format (980 tokens total)
- The system maintains LaViDa's cache compatibility
- LoRA training can proceed with proper gradient flow
- The implementation matches the research methodology described in `SHIRG_RESEARCH_IDEA.md`
